# Cat and Dog Image Classifier using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset. The goal is to create a machine learning model capable of distinguishing between images of cats and dogs with high accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the SVM model is sourced from Kaggle. It consists of a large collection of labeled images of cats and dogs. You can find the dataset Keggles https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running and viewing the notebooks)

You can install these dependencies using pip:
